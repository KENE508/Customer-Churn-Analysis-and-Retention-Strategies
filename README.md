# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Retention-Strategies

### Project Overview 
In this project, I analyzed customer churn data from a telecommunications company to gain insights into the factors most likely to contribute to customer churn. I explored the churn rate across various customer attributes and segmented customers based on characteristics such as tenure and contract type. This segmentation helped identify churn patterns and calculate churn rates for different customer groups, providing actionable insights for improving customer retention.

### Objective
The objective of this analysis is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights to help improve customer retention strategies.
